### The organization behind Go Docker containers is the Docker Community. They provide official Docker images for programming languages, libraries, and applications similar to Go. 
### Some options available when using a Go Docker container could be: Volume Mounting, Container Naming, and Resouce Limits.
### Volume Mapping: Share code or data between your local environment and the container.
### Container Naming: Specify a custom name for containers for easy identification.
### Resouce Limits: Limit CPU and memory resources so conrainers do not consume excessive resources.
### Some key aspects that make Go unique are: Simplicity, Garbage collection, and Open source.
### Simplicity: Syntax is clean & minimalistic which encourages team collaboraion and maintaining code.
### Garbage collection: Automatically manages memory making Go more resilient against crashes and memory issues.
### Open source: Bscked my major companies like Google and encourages collaboration within the Go community.

# 4. Vagrant provisioner: Shell Provisioner
## Let you run and manage scripts inside a virtual guest machine created using Vagrant. Two main methods: You write down the instructions directly 
## in your Vagrant setup file with "inline" scripting, or you give it a file with all the instructions. 
## For POSIX-like operating systems, the shell provisioner uses SSH to execute scripts.
## While Windows guest machines are configured with WinRM, use PowerShell and Batch scripts over WinRM.
## Overall, Shell Provisioner can be used for both simple and elaborate provisioning by letting you talk it through scripts.
#5. Screenshot pictured below:

## Needed to add a new line in the Vagrantfile with the source location and the destination location. After, you would have to go into the ssh and cat the file from the destination which would copy the files from the source.
