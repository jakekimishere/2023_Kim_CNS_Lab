# 3. Completed below:
##  Go (golang)
### The organization behind Go Docker containers is the Docker Community. They provide official Docker images for programming languages, libraries, and applications similar to Go. 
### Some options available when using a Go Docker container could be: Volume Mounting, Container Naming, and Resouce Limits.
### Volume Mapping: Share code or data between your local environment and the container.
### Container Naming: Specify a custom name for containers for easy identification.
### Resouce Limits: Limit CPU and memory resources so conrainers do not consume excessive resources.
### Some key aspects that make Go unique are: Simplicity, Garbage collection, and Open source.
### Simplicity: Syntax is clean & minimalistic which encourages team collaboraion and maintaining code.
### Garbage collection: Automatically manages memory making Go more resilient against crashes and memory issues.
### Open source: Bscked my major companies like Google and encourages collaboration within the Go community.

##  Photon OS
### The organization behind Photon OS is VMWware. VMware is within the virtualization and cloud computing industry. They created it as a minimal Linux container host optimized for running containerized applications in virtualized environments. 
### Some options available when running Photon OS are: Healthchecks, Networking, and Detach mode.
### Healthchecks: Monitor the container's health and restart it if it becomes unhealthy.
### Networking: Controls how containers communicate with each other and the outside world.
### Detach mode: Can run a container in the background for long running processes.
### Photon OS is unique because of: Minimalistic design, Quick boot time, and Container focus.
### Minimalistic design: Reduces the attack surface and makes it more secure and lightweight.
### Quick boot time: Valuable for rapid container deployment and scaling.
### Container focus: Good choice for organizations adopting container technologies with cloud-native applications.

# 4. Completed below:
## Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)
### DVWA is an open-source project does not have a specific organization or company responsible for its development.
### Options available using DVWA are: Port mapping, Customizing database credentials, and Enabling telnet support.
### Port mapping: Map ports between the contaier and the host system.
### Customizing database credentials: You can customize the database configuration by setting environment variables such as DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, and DB_NAME to use your own credentials.
### Enabling telnet support: Allows you to configure various settings through environment variables.
### Some of DVWA's unique features are: Intentional vulnerabilities, Legal and controlled environment, and Graduated difficulty settings.
### Intentional vulnerabilities: Intentionally designed with a wide range of web vulnerabilities, both documented and undocumented.
### Legal and controlled environment: An ideal tool for educational institutions, cybersecurity professionals, and students.
### Graduated difficulty settings: Allows users to start with easier challenges and progressively work their way up to more complex security scenarios.

#5. Screenshot pictured below:

## Needed to add a new line in the Vagrantfile with the source location and the destination location. After, you would have to go into the ssh and cat the file from the destination which would copy the files from the source.
